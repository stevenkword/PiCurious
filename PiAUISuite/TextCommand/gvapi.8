.SH NAME
gvapi \- Use of Google voice API in order to send and receive SMS
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I "gvapi [OPTIONS]..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
gvapi was compiled for use with home automation on the Raspberry Pi but will work on any linux system with an internet connection. It uses curl and boost regex in order to login and stores the cookie in /dev/shm. It only logs in once every 24 hours to save time. It supports a multitude of different options and parameters.
For help/comments/questions, feel free to e-mail me at me@stevenhickson.com. I answer sporadically but do eventually respond.
